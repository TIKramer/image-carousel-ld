# image-carousel-ld
 
Project to practice my react native :)
Made this app as a take home assignment - part of interview process for LeginellaDosser
Displays images from the unsplash api: https://unsplash.com/

## Getting started
### Installing:
run- $npm install  
-can take some time as you have to install react, expo, reactnative..

if you have an android device you can install the app with this .apk, beaware there is only limited usage of api - 50 per day.

### Running:
$npm start  

Good idea to use your own api key for best experience - can only use 50 calls per day
Change the api key in the config file.

## Usage:
App.jsx 
which loads a grid component..
You can see the images - 30 load at a time - scroll down to load more…
